    "Idea: To apply modulo 2 to any binary integer value, we need only read the value of the last bit, (0 or 1), which gives the modulo 2 value of the integer. Not a great insight, as really it is another way of saying that the nature of binary means the 'units' digit of any integer will equal the modulo 2 value. This is true of the units digit for any base where a modulo of the same value as the base is applied (e.g. base 10 modulo 10). With binary, however, there is also the advantage that reading a single bit from memory is probably generally faster than doing modulo math on an integer.
