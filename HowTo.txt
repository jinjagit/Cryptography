To view a 'live' version of a notebook:

1. Use the MyBinder link and wait for server to load, or install Jupyter locally, download and open the notebook.

2. Make sure notebook is 'trusted' (if not; click 'not trusted' in toolbar and select 'trusted').

3. Run all code cells in the order they are presented here, especially the following code cell (imports necessary libraries).

Note: Much code depends on functions, variables, etc., defined in previous code cells (but not all). Simply running a code cell may not ensure all functions it includes are defined, since some may not run until an input is provided.
i.e. 'fully running' a code cell includes providing satisfactory input(s) and the production of all related output(s).

4. MyBinder allegedly provides only 30 minutes maximum of access. Reload if time expires.
