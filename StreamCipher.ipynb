    "Idea: To apply modulo 2 to any binary integer value, we need only read the value of the last bit, (0 or 1), which gives the modulo 2 value of the integer. Not a great insight, as really it is another way of saying that the nature of binary means the 'units' digit of any integer will equal the modulo 2 value. This is true of the units digit for any base where a modulo of the same value as the base is applied (e.g. base 10 modulo 10). With binary, however, there is also the advantage that reading a single bit from memory is probably generally faster than doing modulo math on an integer. However, <i>I imagine</i> most decent math libraries / languages exploit this fact when performing modulo 2 math on an integer (but, I do not know this)."

In practice, the output from many common PRNGs exhibit artifacts that cause them to fail statistical pattern-detection tests [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).

    "Goal: to build the 'perfect' cipher.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Definition:** a cipher is **'unconditionally secure'** (or information theoretically secure) if it cannot be broken even with <i>**infinite**</i> computing resources.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The OTP is a stream cipher where:\n",
    "  1. The key stream bits stem from a TRNG.\n",
    "  2. Each key stream bit is used only once.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Of course, the problem now resides in how to communicate the key to the receiver, since the key is as long as the message!  E.g. encrypting a 400mb video file produces 3.8Gb of key. If the key is safely communicated, the key still needs to be kept safe, and it is potentially very large. Also, if the key is safely communicated, then, given the key is as big as the original data, why not simply communicate the original message using the same method considered viable for the key? Not only this, but the key also is non-reusable (one time) if security is to be maintained.\n",
    "Thus, we can see OTPs are useful in situations where the key can be communicated before the communication becomes threatened. For example, if a spy can carry a stash of pre-defined keys into an espionage situation before his or her communications are liekly to be intercepted, and can keep the keys safe / destroy them when used, this system may be very secure. For remote, network based encrytption, however, these stipulations normally cannot be met.\n",
