Not a great insight, as really it is another way of saying that the nature of binary means the 'units' digit of any integer will equal the modulo 2 value. This is true of the units digit for any base where a modulo of the same value as the base is applied (e.g. base 10 modulo 10). With binary, however, there is also the advantage that reading a single bit from memory is probably generally faster than doing modulo math on an integer.

Generally, they are not adequate for cryptographic use, despite being useful in many other areas of computing (e.g. some software testing). In practice, the output from many common PRNGs exhibit artifacts that cause them to fail statistical pattern-detection tests [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator). They  often calculate PRNs using the formula; $s_0 =$ seed, $s_{i+1} = f(s_i)$, recursively repeated.\n",

Specifically, this means that given $n$ consecutive bits of the key stream, there is no [polynomial time](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolynomialTime.html) algorithm that can predict the next bit $s_{n+1}$ with better than 50% chance of success. Informally, this definition is reduced to: it is computationally infeasible to compute $s_{n+1}$."

If the key is safely communicated, the key still needs to be kept safe, and it is potentially very large. Also, if the key is safely communicated, then, given the key is as big as the original data, then simply communicatingg the original message using the same method considered viable for the key should be considered.

Would brute force stepping through the stream, bit by bit, produce false positive values for A and B, sometimes, ever, always or never? (Easily testable, but perhaps only for an assumed case where it is known that some specific plaintext will  be in the message, but not exactly where. Because, to derive the LCG constants you must know exactly which cipher stream bits represent exactly each of the respective plaintext characters you know are in the message, this may not be simple to overcome. So, actually, it would only be possible to be sure the constants had been derived if the decrytion is successsful (and then detecting this may become the issue), and I have a suspicion any combination of values in $Z2^{31}$ will result in apparent constants, for the carefully chosen constants of the ANSII C rand() modelled here, but not necessarily, or at all, if the actual values of the bitstreams are offset. Need to check this.)\n",
    "2. Similar to above, but what if the length (in bits) of the binary 'character blocks' was not known?\n",
    "3. How many 'good' combinations of values of $A$ and $B$ can be found for, say, the$\\mod{2^{31}}$ used here.\n",
    "4. Right now, it seems obvious that no values prior to the PRNs, deduced from knowledge of plaintext, can be found for ciphertext that relates to plaintext found earlier in the message than the known plaintext, but is this true? Can we generate 'backwards' with a PRNG?\n",
    "5. Given that $2^{31}$ has (only) $2$ as a divisor (other than itself and $1$, which all non-zero integers have), then how do we know the derivation of $A$ and $B$ (from 3 the LCG outputs) will always work. This can only be true if $S_1 - S_2$ never gives an even result, (since an even number $a$ cannot give a gcd of $1$ with the modulo $2^{31}$ (which is also even, hence the gcd must be 2 or more), hence no modular inverse of $a$ exists in such cases, and thus we could not derive $A$ and $B$), which can only happen if the LCG consistently produces alternating odd and even outputs. If the LCG used does this, then why? Given it facilitates an attack vector, is there something useful (or vital) to the LCG about this pattern? And/or is it the only way an LCG can give an illusion of randomness? e.g. EOOEEOOEE would also appear about as 'random', since neither seems very random in terms of 'odd/even-ness'? I still have lots of basic questions about LCGs (and probably PRNGs in general).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about it, a lot of q. 6 is answered by the Wikipedia notes I added to the description of an LCG, above. I am also interested in the 'period' being equal to the modulo $m$. Does this mean the LCG gives a repetitive cycle of the same values, with a period of $m$? Interesting, and easily testable (and if true, would probably better explain why LCGs are horrible for cryptography)."

It basically iterates through division of one number (the larger of the two) by the other, until a remainder of zero is found, with the gcd being the last non-zero remainder found before the zero remainder (except when the first remainder is zero, see note below).

The Extended Euclidean Algorithm provides a more complex iterative (and can be recursive) method to find the values of $s$ and $t$ in Bezout's theorem, which states that for any two integers $a$ and $b$, there must be integers $t$ and $s$, such that $as + bt = \\gcd{a, b}$.
