Explorations and homework:

These files are just my noodlings as I study the "Introduction to Crytopgraphy" course, by Christof Paar: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos

Please check my homework! I don't have access to the 'official' homework answers. Thanks in advance for any constructive input / error highlighting.

NOTE: I am new to Python, so I would advise against using my code as an example of 'good' code ;-)
