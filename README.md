# Cryptography

Explorations and homework:

These files are just my noodlings as I study the "Introduction to Crytopgraphy" course, by Christof Paar.
If you are interested, feel free to follow allong on my blog: https://cryptographystudies.wordpress.com/resources/

Also, feel free to check my homework! (I don't have access to the 'official' homework answers).
