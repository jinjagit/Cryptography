# Cryptography

Explorations and homework:

These files are just my noodlings as I study the "Introduction to Crytopgraphy" course, by Christof Paar: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos

If you are interested, feel free to follow allong on my blog: https://cryptographystudies.wordpress.com/resources/

Also, please check my homework! (I don't have access to the 'official' homework answers). Thanks in advance for any constructive input / error highlighting.

NOTE: I am new to Python, so I would advise against using my code as an example of 'good' code ;-)
